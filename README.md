# Bird View

Allow yourself to become more organized and productive by viewing your tasks from a bird's eye view.
Bird View is a productivity google extension app based on a prototype named BonBon (built in AtomHacks). 

Procrastination and being unorganized is a big problem for many teenagers and college students. While planners allow students to write down detailed schedules, it is easier for a digital copy to appear on the side when they are on google chrome. With organized checklists broken down into categories, alarms to force pages to open, and a bookmarking system, it allows users to be on task every minute.
